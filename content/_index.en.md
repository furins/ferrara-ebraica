The Jews and Ferrara, a **millennial and inextricably intertwined relationship**.

A story well known by the whole Jewish world, which tells of moments of encounter and integration alternated with others that are much darker. With it, the MEIS wanted to go back to its origins and explain to visitors, the city and the general public why the museum was built in Ferrara.

The path of the exhibition accompanies the visitor through a journey through time, capturing the peculiar identity and the main stages of the ancient and still vital Ferrara Jewish community.
