Another essential center where the foundations of the Jewish life are passed down is the family.

In addition to public functions, Judaism includes a series of family festivals with rituals marked by the family praying and dining together. Among these, two
festivals bear a strong cultural identity. The first is *Pesach*, the Jewish Easter, which recalls the exodus of the Jewish people from Egypt and its liberation from
slavery. Every year, Jewish families sit around the holiday table to recount the *Pesach* story, reading the text of the Haggadah (story/legend), eating foods which have symbolic meaning and reaffirming their connection to Judaism at all times and in all places.

The second of these holidays is *Sukkot*, the Feast of Tabernacles or Huts, recalling the forty years the People of Israel wandered in the desert after fleeing
Egypt. According to tradition, during *Sukkot*, meals are consumed in a tent under the stars. Often the feasts are occasions for convivial moments and the members of the community gather together to eat under a single hut.
