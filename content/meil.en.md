{{% p %}}# *Meil* â€“ Mantle
The *Torah* is clothed in prized ornamental fabric dressings called meilim (mantles).

Jewish tradition requires active participation from the women in preparing vestments to honor the Lord and his Law, items to be made following Biblical
recommendations for embroidery, the text specifying the types of fabrics and designs, the use of rich colors, golden threads and precious stones.
In some cases, the meilim are made of fabrics that were originally used in clothing, often petticoats. This most likely stems from the fact that, in many
communities, the Jews were often actively engaged in the textile trade.
