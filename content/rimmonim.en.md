{{% p %}}# *Rimmonim* – Finials
The term *rimmonim* originally derives from the shape of these ritual objects which were crafted to resemble pomegranates (in Hebrew *rimmon*, plural
*rimmonim*).

They are set on the tips of the *Torah* scroll handles, although, in some cases, simpler silver finials are used. The pinnacle was generally embellished with
decorations reminiscent of the vestments from the Temple in Jerusalem and the attire of the *Cohanim* (the priests).

Often the rimmonim are topped with bells that jingle as the *Torah* moves, thus imparting a festive air, a sense of celebration to accompany the reading.
