{{% p %}}In the Jewish society of Ferrara, the fulcrum of community life is the synagogue, the place where religious services are held, but also a place to meet.
For prayers to be held in public, with the reading of the *Torah*, Judaism requires a quorum of at least 10 Jewish men, called a minian. 

When this condition is
not met, prayers are said individually and not as a community and chanting of the *Torah* portion and *haftarah*, a passage from the Books of the Prophets, is not
done.

When a *minian* is present, the prayers are accompanied by the singing of the *Hazan*, or cantor, who guides the rest of the faithful during the course of the
service. 

Jewish communities differ from one another in the way they chant their prayers, each following local traditions and melodies.{{% /p %}}

# Tallit of Leone Leoni
A *tallit* is a shawl worn by men during morning prayers or after reciting a blessing. The one on display here belonged to the rabbi from Ferrara, Leone Leoni
(1897-1964), whose story is entwined with that of the community.

On the evening of September 21, 1941, a group of Fascists entered the synagogue complex on via Mazzini 95, destroying the Fanese and German synagogues:
the furnishings were damaged, some sacred objects stolen and the *Sifrei Torah* or Torah scrolls (the Books of the Law) were burned at an improvised bonfire
in nearby piazza Trento Trieste. That evening the fascists battered down the door to the home of Rabbi Leone Leoni who, in an attempt to halt destruction of
the Synagogues and protect his family, was slapped around by the fascists.
