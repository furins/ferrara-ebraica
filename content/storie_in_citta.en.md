Jewish Ferrara encompasses many stories —some well-known and others less so. As is often the case, bad times alternate with good ones.

Historically, the Jews of Ferrara settled in a triangular area delineated by via Mazzini, via Vignatagliata and via Vittoria. Via Mazzini, in particular, has seen a
series of businesses and shops owned by members of the local community flourish over time. The flavors of the kosher (suitable for consumption) specialties
of the shop run by Nuta (Benvenuta Ascoli) and the essences found in the [Finzi perfumery](/en/profumeria_finzi) still live in people’s memories.

The changes in the city at the beginning of the twentieth century bear, in part, the mark of Ferrara’s Jewish citizens: simply consider the town plans and the Art
Nouveau architecture of Ciro Contini or the monumental statues by Arrigo Minerbi.

There is no inhabitant of Ferrara who does not remember the terrible [massacre at the Castle](/en/eccidio_castello), an open wound in the heart of the city that could escape the
attention of a less aware visitor, but which marked the beginning of the physical elimination of Jews and anti-fascists.

Jewish history permeates Ferrara and the community shares the successes, vices and virtues of its city. Indeed, not even the racial laws of 1938 were able to make the people of this community feel foreing, as reflected in the writings of [Silvio Magrini](/en/silvio_magrini).
