{{% p %}}# *Tas* â€“ Breastplate
The *Sifrei Torah* (Scrolls of the Law) are often fit with a silver breastplate called a *tas*.

As a general rule, the Communities have more than one *Sefer Torah* (generally, the greater the number of *Sifrei Torah* a community owned, the greater its
economic and cultural wealth). Moreover, some festivals or holidays require reading different passages from separate scrolls: for this reason, these
breastplates often bear inscriptions indicating when the scroll is to be read. 

Some tas have a dedication, in Hebrew, bearing the name of the donor.
